	<p>Originally from San Antonio, TX, Geoffrey currently resides in New York City. A rather shy child, Geoffrey surprised everyone in his break-out performance as Sylvester McMonkey McBean in his first grade production of Dr. Suess's "The Sneetches." A pianist from the age of 6, he also began to study the cello in his formative years, but his heart was always set on the stage.</p><br>
