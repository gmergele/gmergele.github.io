	<p>Originally from Texas and after 13 years in New York City, Geoffrey now resides in sunny Florida. A rather shy child, Geoffrey surprised everyone in his break-out performance as Sylvester McMonkey McBean in his first grade production of Dr. Suess's "The Sneetches." A pianist from the age of 6, he also began to study the cello in his formative years, but his heart was always set on the stage.</p>
	<p>You may have seen Geoffrey touring North America as a Crow, Poppy, Ozian, and the scariest Jitterbug you've ever seen in the national tour of "The Wizard of Oz." He has also worked at all three theatres owned by the Prather Entertainment Group in productions of "Damn Yankees," "Wonderful Town," "A Christmas Carol," and "George M!" Summer stock credits include stints at Jenny Wiley Theatre, Surflight Theatre, and Saxtons River Playhouse.</p>
	<p>Geoffrey's favorite role to date is Will Parker in "Oklahoma!" at the Wohlfahrt Haus Dinner Theatre where he also performed in productions of "Crazy For You," "Damn Yankees," and "The Rocky Horror Show." You can catch Geoffrey on film in the short "MBFF" (chosen as one of the Top Shorts of the Harlem International Film Festival 2016), the webseries "Fat Guy" and as The Bacardi Bar Eel.</p>
